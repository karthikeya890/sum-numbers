# Addition Assignment

In this assignment, you will implement a function that adds two numbers.

## Instructions

1. Edit the `solution.js` file to implement the `add` function.
2. The function should take two parameters `a` and `b` and return their sum.
3. Make sure to handle both integers and decimals.
4. The function should also convert string inputs to numbers.

## Testing

You can test your solution locally by running:

```
npm install
npm test
```

When you push your code to GitHub, the tests will run automatically and your score will be updated on the GitHub Classroom dashboard.

## Grading

This assignment has multiple test cases. Each passing test is worth 1 point. Your final score will be the number of tests that your solution passes.
